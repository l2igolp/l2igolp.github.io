Mario Galletti’s work on optimising ultra-broadband optical parametric amplification in BiBO and YCOB at L2I has now been accepted for publication in High Power Laser Science and Engineering. Additionally, the work is selected as Editor’s Pick and features on the cover of this issue (image above).

In this work, we evaluate and demonstrate ultra-broadband near-infrared noncollinear optical parametric amplification in two nonlinear crystals, bismuth borate (BiBO) and yttrium calcium oxyborate (YCOB), which are not commonly used for this application. The spectral bandwidth is of the microjoule level; the amplified signal is ≥ 200 nm, capable of supporting sub-10 fs pulses. These results, supported by numerical simulations, show that these crystals have a great potential as nonlinear media in both low-energy, few-cycle systems and high peak power amplifiers for terawatt to petawatt systems based on noncollinear optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (NOPCPA) or a hybrid.
