Victor Hariton has left the team and moved to star a postdoc position at the Laser Science and Technology team of DESY, in Germany,

During his stay in our team, Victor gave contributions in different fields, from femtosecond ablation with shaped pulses (for which he was awarded the Gulbenkian Stimulus to Scientific Research prize in 2017) to studies in thermal lensing in Yb-doped media, amplifier development and more recently to nonlinear spectral broadening and pulse compression in multipass cells, in collaboration with Oleg Pronin‘s team at HSU.

Best wishes to Victor!
