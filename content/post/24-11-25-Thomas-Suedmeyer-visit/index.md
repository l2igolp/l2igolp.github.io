Last November 21 we had the pleasure of hosting <a href="https://www.unine.ch/ltf/home/team/la-direction/thomas-sudmeyer.html">Thomas Südmeyer</a>, Director of the Time and Frequency Laboratory at the Physics Department of the Université de Neuchâtel, for a lab tour and discussion.

Prof. Südmeyer is a renowned specialist in photonics, metrology, and ultrashort pulse science. He has coordinated several Swiss and European projects, is the recipient of an ERC Starting Grant, and served as an Associate Editor for Optics Express (2009–2015) and IEEE Photonics Technology Letters (2014–2017). We had an interesting conversation about current perspectives, trends and opportunities in our common research in ultrafast laser science.
