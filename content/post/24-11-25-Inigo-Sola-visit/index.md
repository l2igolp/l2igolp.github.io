Last June 21 our team had the pleasure of hosting <a href="https://produccioncientifica.usal.es/investigadores/57746/detalle">Íñigo Sola</a> for a lab tour and seminar. Íñigo is a Full Professor at the Applied Physics Department of the University of Salamanca and a researcher at the <a href="https://produccioncientifica.usal.es/grupos/3688/detalle">ALF-USAL</a> group.

In his talk he discussed both research and academic activities at the University of Salamanca, covering areas such as ultrafast laser technology, nonlinear light-matter interaction, attoscience, and laser processing applications. He presented USAL’s Master in Laser Science and Technology and we exchanged many interesting ideas both in teaching and research.
