Our new mid-infrared laser has arrived and has been successfully installed!

The system consists of:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amphos.de/">Amphos</a> pump laser: 100 kHz, 100 W, 1 ps, 1 mJ/pulse, 1030 nm</li>
<li><a href="https://fastlite.com/">Fastlite</a> OPCPA: 100 kHz, 6 W, 40 fs, 60 µJ/pulse, 3100 nm, with CEP stability (<150 mrad rms)</li>
</ul>
This system is the main component in the scope of the National Roadmap project at IST. It is complemented by a fast acquisition rack device (Fastlite Big Brozzer), a mid-infrared spectrometer (Fastlite Mozza), and a beam stabilization system for the pump laser (MRC Systems).

The new lasers (1030 nm and 3100 nm) will be used for experiments on nonlinear optics and harmonic generation.
