Mario Galletti has left the team and moved to star an Assistant Professor at the Physics Department of the Università degli Studi di Roma – Tor Vergata, Rome, Italy.

During his stay in our team, Mario was extremely prolific and spread his research activity over several areas, from optical parametric oscillation and amplification, nonlinear optical crystals, optical diagnostics, FROG and GRENOUILLE pulse diagnostics, as well as contributing to experiments on electron acceleration through laser plasma interaction. He published 9 papers in the scope of his PhD thesis, which received national and international awards.

Tanti auguri Mario!
