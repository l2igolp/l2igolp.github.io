Our most recent work on spectral broadening in multipass cells was now published in Optics Express, with my former PhD student (now Dr.) Victor Hariton as the first author and main driving force behind this idea, together with collaborators K. Fritsch, K. Schwarz, N. Kovalenko, G. Arisholm and O. Pronin.

In this work, we introduce a novel multi-pass convex-concave arrangement, which exhibits crucial properties such as large mode size and compactness. In a proof-of-principle experiment, 260 fs, 15 µJ and 200 µJ pulses are broadened and subsequently compressed to approximately 50 fs with 90% efficiency and excellent spatio-spectral homogeneity across the beam profile. We simulate the proposed concept for spectral broadening of 40 mJ and 1.3 ps input pulses and discuss the possibility of further scaling.
