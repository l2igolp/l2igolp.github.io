Victor Hariton has just published another paper covering an important part of his PhD research, resulting from the successful collaboration with Oleg Pronin‘s team at HSU.

In this work, multipass spectral broadening and compression around 515 nm are experimentally demonstrated. A nonlinear multipass cell with a bulk medium is used to compress 250-fs pulses down to 38 fs. The same input pulses create a sufficient bandwidth for sub-20-fs pulse generation in a multipass cell with gaseous media. In both cases, the efficiency exceeds 85%. Dispersion management by reduction of the cell size and the thickness of the nonlinear medium allows an efficient generation of ultrashort pulses in the visible range and establishes a pathway for ultraviolet spectral broadening by means of multipass cells.
