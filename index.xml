He was supervised by Gonçalo Figueira (left).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During his work, Miguel investigated second-order spatiotemporal couplings in ultrashort pulses, a phenomenon that becomes relevant for few-cycle pulses and that has attracted growing attention in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;He developed a numerical code for visualizing and propagating laser pulses with this type of coupling and investigated how their intensity and instantaneous colour change with propagation. The code was then successfully applied to study pulses exhibiting pulse front curvature, radial chirp and other distortions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MSc jury, consisting of Marco Piccardo, Jorge Vieira and Marta Fajardo (from the center to right), highlighted the development of the new simulation tool and the challenging nature of the problem studied, and awarded a final grade of 18/20.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The thesis was Miguel’s last step in concluding his MSc in Physics Engineering at IST. Congratulations!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Thomas Südmeyer visit</title><link>https://example.com/post/24-11-25-thomas-suedmeyer-visit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Nov 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://example.com/post/24-11-25-thomas-suedmeyer-visit/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Last November 21 we had the pleasure of hosting &lt;a href="https://www.unine.ch/ltf/home/team/la-direction/thomas-sudmeyer.html"&gt;Thomas Südmeyer&lt;/a&gt;, Director of the Time and Frequency Laboratory at the Physics Department of the Université de Neuchâtel, for a lab tour and discussion.&lt;/p&gt;

Her work was supervised by Gonçalo Figueira, Hugo Pires (both at IPFN/IST) and Jens Biegert (ICFO, Spain).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During her Ph.D. in the scope of the APPLAuSE programme, Joana specialised in the study of ultrafast mid-infrared (3-8 µm) laser technology, in particular nonlinear amplification of ultrashort pulses through OPCPA and their compression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She evaluated strategies for achieving few-cycle, millijoule-level pulses in this wavelength region, working with three different laser systems, at the Laboratory for Intense Lasers, IST and at the Attosecond and Ultrafast Optics group at ICFO. One of the main results is the implementation study of a new ultrafast (5-optical-cycles), high energy (5 mJ), 3 μm laser system and an analysis of the main challenges for compressing pulses at this wavelength range.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PhD jury, consisting of Greg Greetham (STFC, UK), Olivier Chalus (Thales, France), Ana G. Silva (FCT-UNL, Portugal), Gareth Williams (IPFN/IST), Gonçalo Figueira and Luís L. Alves (both Phys. Dept. IST), unanimously highlighted the significant amount of effort, the quality and the high impact of her achievements.&lt;/p&gt;

Fritsch, K. Schwarz, N. Kovalenko, G. Arisholm and O. Pronin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we introduce a novel multi-pass convex-concave arrangement, which exhibits crucial properties such as large mode size and compactness. In a proof-of-principle experiment, 260 fs, 15 µJ and 200 µJ pulses are broadened and subsequently compressed to approximately 50 fs with 90% efficiency and excellent spatio-spectral homogeneity across the beam profile. We simulate the proposed concept for spectral broadening of 40 mJ and 1.3 ps input pulses and discuss the possibility of further scaling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During his stay in our team, Victor gave contributions in different fields, from femtosecond ablation with shaped pulses (for which he was awarded the Gulbenkian Stimulus to Scientific Research prize in 2017) to studies in thermal lensing in Yb-doped media, amplifier development and more recently to nonlinear spectral broadening and pulse compression in multipass cells, in collaboration with Oleg Pronin‘s team at HSU.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this work, multipass spectral broadening and compression around 515 nm are experimentally demonstrated. A nonlinear multipass cell with a bulk medium is used to compress 250-fs pulses down to 38 fs. The same input pulses create a sufficient bandwidth for sub-20-fs pulse generation in a multipass cell with gaseous media. In both cases, the efficiency exceeds 85%. Dispersion management by reduction of the cell size and the thickness of the nonlinear medium allows an efficient generation of ultrashort pulses in the visible range and establishes a pathway for ultraviolet spectral broadening by means of multipass cells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thesis, with the title of “High contrast front-end for a petawatt laser system designed for electron acceleration &amp;amp; High-intensity laser-matter applications towards advanced compact particle accelerators” was supervised by Prof. Gonçalo Figueira (Instituto Superior Tecnico, Universidade de Lisboa) and Dr. Marco Galimberti (Central Laser Facility, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Oxford).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We present a design for OPCPA and demonstrate that with a configuration of a single crystal or combination of crystals (KTA and MgO:LN) it is possible to achieve output energies above the mJ with sufficient bandwidth to allow compression to just 5-optical cycles. We consider a 1 µm mJ-level picosecond chirped-pulse amplifier (CPA), a typical pumping source for this type of nonlinear amplifiers. Compression with a simple bulk material enables reaching close to the pulse Fourier-transform limited duration, paving the way to high-energy, ultrafast mid-infrared pulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This work will now be pursued experimentally with the development of an upgrade to our 3 µm laser system.&lt;/p&gt;

The prize recognizes truly outstanding research achievements associated with a PhD study in the broad field of plasma physics. Up to four prizes are given annually to young scientists from the 38 European countries associated with the EPS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mario’s thesis is entitled “High contrast front-end for a petawatt laser system designed for electron acceleration &amp;amp; High-intensity laser-matter applications towards advanced compact particle accelerators” and was supervised by Prof. Gonçalo Figueira (IPFN, IST) and Dr. Mario Galimberti (CLF, STFC, UK).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In his thesis, Mario investigated the generation of ultrashort laser pulses in the near-infrared region between 750 and 1000 nm, which is of interest for current large scale laser projects based on optical parametric amplification. He designed and developed highly efficient ultra-broadband Optical Parametric Amplification (OPA) stages in the femtosecond and picosecond regime, as well as the associated temporal diagnostics. The systems were implemented at the Laboratory for Intense Lasers (IST) and at the Vulcan laser system (CLF) in the scope of facility upgrades for laser-plasma interaction and pump-probe experiments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, he investigated one of the most promising applications of ultrashort, high-intensity lasers: Target Normal Sheath Acceleration (TNSA), which finds applications such as radiotherapy, isotope production, fusion fast ignition schemes and proton imaging. The experimental research for this topic was conducted in collaboration with the SPARC-LAB group at LNF-INFN (Italy).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After being awarded the top final grade of Approved with Distinction Cum Laude at his PhD defence, Mario returned to Italy, where he is now a researcher at Frascati National Laboratory.&lt;/p&gt;

Additionally, the work is selected as Editor’s Pick and features on the cover of this issue (image above).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this work, we evaluate and demonstrate ultra-broadband near-infrared noncollinear optical parametric amplification in two nonlinear crystals, bismuth borate (BiBO) and yttrium calcium oxyborate (YCOB), which are not commonly used for this application. The spectral bandwidth is of the microjoule level; the amplified signal is ≥ 200 nm, capable of supporting sub-10 fs pulses. These results, supported by numerical simulations, show that these crystals have a great potential as nonlinear media in both low-energy, few-cycle systems and high peak power amplifiers for terawatt to petawatt systems based on noncollinear optical parametric chirped pulse amplification (NOPCPA) or a hybrid.&lt;/p&gt;
